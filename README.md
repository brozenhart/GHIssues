# GHIssues

To be able to use the Github API you need to provide some credentials. You can generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for yourself. After you have the token, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and insert the following variables:
```
API_USERNAME=__put_whatever_username_here__
API_TOKEN=__your_personal_access_token_here__
```
> Note: Don't use any quotation marks

> Using a token is not a requirement to use the app, but it gives you more api call per day. You do however need to create the `.env` file to be able to compile the app.
